  # This line applies the session store configuration (set in the first line) to the middleware stack. 
  # This enables Rails to manage user sessions using cookies.
  # It ensures that the cookie store (which stores session data in cookies) is actually used when processing requests. 
  # Without this, the session data would not be saved in cookies properly.
  # This ties together the session store settings and the middleware that handles each request.
  # It ensures that the session data (like a JWT token) is correctly saved in cookies and sent back to the server 
  # whenever the user makes a request.
